ShowTime respects your privacy and recognizes the need to protect the personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified,
 such as name, address, and telephone number) you share with us. We would like to assure you that we follow appropriate standards when it comes to
 protecting your privacy on our web sites.
There are times when we may collect personal information from you such as name, physical address or telephone number. It is our intent to inform you
 before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do with the information. Generally, you will have the option not to provide the information, and in the
 future you will be able to "opt out" of certain uses of the information. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit the
 ShowTime website, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers and services.
ShowTime  will not sell, trade or disclose to third parties any information derived from the registration for, or use of, any online service (including names and addresses)
 without the consent of the user or customer (except as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process or in the case of imminent physical harm to the 
user or others). ShowTime will allow suppliers to access the information for purposes of confirming your registration and providing you with benefits you are entitled to.
ShowTime  will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us. We have implemented technology and security features and strict policy guidelines to 
safeguard the privacy of your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and improper use or disclosure. ShowTime will continue to enhance our
 security procedures as new technology becomes available.
If our privacy policy changes in the future, it will be posted here and a new effective date will be shown. You should access our privacy policy regularly to ensure you 
understand our current policies. Please reference the privacy policy in your subject line. ShowTime  will attempt to respond to all reasonable concerns or inquiries within
 five business days of receipt.
Privacy Policy updated as on 14th Mar, 2017.
